Diabetes Dataset Analysis
Overview
This project involves the analysis of a diabetes dataset to explore the relationships between various features such as age, glucose levels, BMI, and blood pressure in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. The dataset is visualized using different types of plots including scatter plots, histograms, and box plots to uncover patterns and insights.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is diabetes.csv. It contains several features including:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Steps
Import Libraries and Load Data

Import necessary libraries and load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Preparation

Convert column names to lowercase for consistency.

Descriptive Statistics

Generate descriptive statistics for the dataset to understand the distribution of the data.

Data Segmentation

Segment the data into diabetic and non-diabetic groups based on the Outcome column.

Visualization

Scatter Plot: Plot age vs. glucose levels for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Histogram: Plot the frequency distribution of glucose levels and BMI for both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Box Plot: Plot the distribution of blood pressure, diabetes pedigree function, and age for diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Scatter Plot: Plot insulin vs. glucose levels for both groups.
Statistical Insights

Calculate and print the mean and median values for glucose levels, BMI, and age to compare diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
Conclusion
The analysis of the diabetes dataset reveals significant differences in glucose levels, BMI, and other health metrics between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. These insights can help in understanding the characteristics of diabetic patients and may assist in early diagnosis and treatment planning.
